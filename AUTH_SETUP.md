# Authentication Setup Guide

## Issues Fixed

The authentication page had several problems that prevented sign-in from working:

1. **Missing Supabase import** - The page was trying to use `supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth()` without importing the Supabase client
2. **Incomplete authentication logic** - The actual Google sign-in was commented out and replaced with placeholder code
3. **Missing auth callback handling** - No page to handle the OAuth redirect after Google authentication
4. **Poor error handling** - Limited error feedback for users

## What Was Fixed

1. ✅ Added proper Supabase import to the auth page
2. ✅ Implemented complete Google OAuth authentication flow
3. ✅ Created auth callback page (`/auth/callback`) to handle OAuth redirects
4. ✅ Added proper error handling and user feedback
5. ✅ Created dashboard page for authenticated users
6. ✅ Added sign-out functionality

## Required Setup

### 1. Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 2. Supabase Project Configuration

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to Authentication > Settings
3. Add your domain to "Site URL" (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`)
4. Add redirect URLs:
   - `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
   - `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`

### 3. Google OAuth Setup

1. In Supabase dashboard, go to Authentication > Providers
2. Enable Google provider
3. Add your Google OAuth credentials:
   - Client ID
   - Client Secret
4. Add authorized redirect URIs in Google Cloud Console:
   - `https://your-project.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`

## How It Works Now

1. User clicks "Sign in with Google" button
2. Google OAuth flow is initiated via Supabase
3. User authenticates with Google
4. Google redirects back to `/auth/callback`
5. Callback page verifies the session
6. User is redirected to `/dashboard` if successful
7. Dashboard shows user info and sign-out option

## Testing

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `/auth`
3. Click "Sign in with Google"
4. Complete Google authentication
5. You should be redirected to the dashboard

## Troubleshooting

- Check browser console for error messages
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Ensure Supabase project is properly configured
- Check that Google OAuth credentials are valid
- Verify redirect URLs match between Supabase and Google Cloud Console
